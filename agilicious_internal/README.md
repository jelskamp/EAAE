**Agilicious** is a co-designed hardware and software framework tailored to autonomous, agile quadrotor flight, which has been developed and used since 2016 at the [Robotics and Perception Group (RPG)](http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/) of the University of Zurich. Agilicious is described in this [Science Robotics 2022 paper](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/docs/ScienceRobotics22_Foehn.pdf).
It is completely open-source and open-hardware and supports both model-based and neural-network-based controllers. 
Also, it provides high thrust-to-weight and torque-to-inertia ratios for agility, onboard vision sensors, GPU-accelerated compute hardware for real-time perception and neural-network inference, a real-time flight controller, and a versatile software stack.
In contrast to existing frameworks, Agilicious offers a unique combination of flexible software and high-performance hardware.
Agilicious has been used in over 30 scientific papers at our lab, including trajectory tracking for drone racing scenarios at up to 5g and 70km/h ([SciRob21_Foehn](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/docs/ScienceRobotics21_Foehn.pdf), [Video](https://youtu.be/ZPI8U1uSJUs)), vision-based acrobatic flight ([RSS20 Kaufmann](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/docs/RSS20_Kaufmann.pdf), [Video](https://youtu.be/2N_wKXQ6MXA)), obstacle avoidance in both structured and unstructured environments using solely onboard perception ([SciRob21_Loquercio](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/docs/Loquercio21_Science.pdf), [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m89bNn6RFoQ)), and hardware-in-the-loop simulation in virtual-reality environments.
Thanks to its versatility, we believe that Agilicious supports the next generation of scientific and industrial quadrotor research.
The full list of publications using Agilicious can be found [here](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/aggressive_flight.html).

# What's in it for you?

Agilicious is split in two parts, *agilib* and *agiros*.

*agilib* contains base classes and module implementations providing the base functionality necessary for agile flight.
It contains controllers, estimators, and logic, but with minimal dependencies (mainly [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)).
It allows users to integrate Agilicious into their own infrastructure and can easily be extended with new modules.
Meanwhile, *agiros* provides bindings to common [ROS](https://www.ros.org) interfaces, which make it easy and quick to set up and get flying, both in simulation and real world.

In summary, this library offers the following modules:

* Pipelines
  provide a modular way to combine controllers, estimators, reference trajectories into a complete control system.
  It is posible to create multiple pipelines and switch between them at runtime, allowing rapid prototyping.
* Controllers
  + Outerloop controller
    + Model Predictive Control described in [Falanga IROS'18](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/docs/IROS18_Falanga.pdf) and [Sun TRO'22](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/docs/Arxiv21_MPC_Sun.pdf)
    + Differential-Flatness-Based Geometric Control described in [Sun TRO'22](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/docs/Arxiv21_MPC_Sun.pdf)
  + Innerlop controller
    + Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion described in [Sun TRO'20](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9160894)
    + Cascaded PID similar to [Faessler RAL'18](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/docs/RAL18_Faessler.pdf)
* Estimators
  * A standard EKF using a pose estimate and propagating with IMU measurements.
  * An EKF that uses a constant acceleration model and the Pose + IMU measurements.
  * A feedthrough module that provides a simple way to pipe in your own estimate sources.
  * A mock estimator that can corrupt an estimate with noise and bias to simulate real-world properties.
* References
  * Hover
  * Velocity Commands
  * Sampled Trajectories
  * Polynomial Trajectories
* Samplers
  * Time-based sampling along a given reference.
  * Positional sampling along a given reference which allows to robustly handle large disturbances.
* Bridges
  * [RotorS](https://github.com/ethz-asl/rotors_simulator) interface
  * Serial bridge to interface with our own flight control software
  * Serial bridge to interface through [LAIRD](https://www.lairdconnect.com) wireless modules.
  * Serial bridge to interface with [BetaFlight controllers](https://betaflight.com).
* Pilot
  which handles all logic and interfacing.
* Guard
  A safety guard implementation that can use a secondary estimate (e.g. motion capture) and take over if some criteria are invalidated.
  The guard can use a secondary pipeline configuration without relying on the user-defined modules.
  This allows for rapid prototyping with a virtual "safety net".
* Simulator
  A sophisticated and configurable simulation that runs magnitudes faster than real time and optionally provides aerodynamic BEM models as described in [Bauersfeld RSS'21](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/docs/RSS21_Bauersfeld.pdf).

# Agilicious Hardware Platform
If you want to replicate the Agilicious hardware platform, follow this [step-by-step guide](miscellaneous/documentation/hardware_platform.md).


# Getting Started
If you use ROS, simply clone agilicious into your `catkin` workspace and `catkin build`:
```
# Create new catkin workspace.
cd catkin_ws/src

git clone https://github.com/catkin/catkin_simple
git clone https://github.com/ethz-asl/mav_comm.git
git clone git@github.com:uzh-rpg/agilicious.git

catkin build
```


If you want to use the library standalone, you can always

```
cd agilib/build
cmake ..
make
```

It is highly recommended to run agilicious inside a docker container, instructions are available [here](miscellaneous/documentation/how_to_docker.md).

## Launch your first simulation:

For launching simulations you need ROS. Once your compilation using `catkin build` has been successful, you can then source your catkin workspace and launch two different types of simulation:
 - Agisim simulation, by running the command `roslaunch agiros agisim.launch`. This simulation environment has been written by us and supports different levels of complexity. These levels of complexity can be configured in the file `agiros/agiros/parameters/simulation.yaml`, where, for example, if we would comment the lines with "ModelRotorSimple" and uncomment the lines with "ModelRotorBEM", then a BEM simulation will be launched. 
 - Gazebo RotorS simulation, by running the command `roslaunch agiros simulation.launch`

These simulation environments allow the user to test their code by offering a user friendly GUI. The simplest task would be a "Go to pose", which can directly be executed by pressing buttons in the GUI. More complex maneuvers can also be performed, like trajectory tracking. For this, the trajectory can be loaded from a `.csv` file

</div>

### How do I change the characteristics of my simulation?
Everything is structured in `.yaml` files. The most important of these `.yaml` files is the so-called "Pilot" file. For example, when launching the Agisim simulation, the `agiros/agiros/parameters/simple_sim_pilot.yaml` file is used. Here, the user can define which outer / inner controller to use, which estimator to use, which quadrotor model to use, etc. If one were to change the mass of the quadrotor, for example, one would in this case need to modify the `agiros/agiros/parameters/quads/kingfisher.yaml` file.

## Launch your first real flight:
### Vision-based flight
For launching a real flight, you need to connect a RealSense T265 to the USB port of the onboard jetson TX2. The procedure to launch your quadrotor is very simple:
1. Boot up the Jetson TX2.
2. Inside the Jetson TX2, compile the Agilicious codebase.
3. Launch the controllers and camera estimation by running: `roslaunch outdoor_quadrotor.launch quad_name:=<your quad name>`
4. In your computer, which must be connected to the same WiFi network as your quadrotor, do `roslaunch outdoor_basecomputer.launch quad_name:=<your quad name>`. Don't forget to setup your ros IPs properly. You can have the rosmaster either inside the drone or in the computer, and both nodes need to be setup accordingly.
5. In your computer you will see the same GUI that pops up when you run a simulation. Press the `Connect` button and the voltage and state estimation values should appear in the GUI. Note that this time, the voltage value and the state estimation values come from the real hardware. Make sure that these values are sane and consistent.
6. Arm your quad by pressing the `Arm Bridge`. The rotors should spin at this stage.
7. If everything looks sane, press `Start` to takeoff!

### Run controller onboad and fly with VICON:
You can also run your controller onboard the Jetson TX2 with VICON, by following these steps:
1. Boot up the Jetson TX2.
2. Inside the Jetson TX2, compile the Agilicious codebase.
3. Set the onboard_pilot.yaml to change the controller, estimator, and other meta parameters (such as control frequency). There are two outer controllers of choice: MPC and GEO. Both controllers generate motor thrust commands that can be used directly by the low-level controller. On top of that, you may also activate inner controllers to adapt these commands for improving robustness. There are two inner controllers of choice: PID and INDI.
4. You can change the parameters of each controller in the corresponding yaml file. For example, to alter gains of MPC, use mpc.yaml (located in agilib/params folder)
5. You can change the parameters of the bridge connecting to the low-level board in ctrl.yaml, such as port name, baud rate, etc. This low-level board should be able to feed the thrust commands of each motor to the ESC, and return RPM measurement.
6. On your laptop, launch the GUI, VRPN client, and Rviz by running: `roslaunch arena_base_computer_onboard.launch quad_name:=<your quad name>`
7. On Jetson TX2, launch the controllers and VICON-based estimation by running: `roslaunch arena_quadrotor_onboard.launch quad_name:=<your quad name>`
8. In your computer you will see the same GUI that pops up when you run a simulation. Press the `Connect` button and the voltage and state estimation values should appear in the GUI. Note that this time, the voltage value and the state estimation values come from the real hardware. Make sure that these values are sane and consistent.
9. Arm your quad by pressing the `Arm Bridge`. The rotors should spin at this stage.
10. If everything looks sane, press `Start` to takeoff!
11. You can import the reference trajectory in .csv format in the GUI. We have provided several reference trajectories as examples. They are stored in miscellaneous/datasets/ref_trajs.zip (ATTENTION: These references are rather fast. Test them in the simulation before hand!!). The CPC33_Z1.csv is the reference being used in Fig.13 of [Sun TRO'22](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/docs/Arxiv21_MPC_Sun.pdf). We have also included the flight data in miscellaneous/datasets/CPC33_data.zip for the users for comparison.
